# Mini---Project-
This project involves building a microservice that uploads CSV files to a PostgreSQL database via a REST API, retrieves records from the database using GET requests, and uses Logrus for logging. Additionally, the project includes unit testing and Dockerizing the entire application for containerization and easy deployment.
